								<a href="images/Ian_Trail.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/chili_trail.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Chili</h3>
								<p>Chili is an eleven-year-old arabian-rocky mountain gelding with a lot of patience and a lot of pride. Standing at 15 hands, he is the perfect beginner to intermediate level horse for all ages, and he knows it.</p>

								<a href="images/Jess_Iris_Erin_2.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/Iris.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Iris</h3>
								<p>Iris is a pretty, 14.3 hand full arabian mare who is as loving as she is eager to please. At fourteen-years-old, her patience makes her particularly good with children. Happily in your pocket, she is an excellent horse for beginner to intermediate riders.</p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/phoebeCloseup.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/phoebeCloseup.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Phoebe</h3>
								<p>With a lot more go still in her than woah, this eighteen year old off the track mare is a smooth ride for intermediate to advanced riders. Standing at 16 hands tall, this retired race horse will trot with you for hours, and slobber all over you in thanks afterwards.</p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/dallasCloseup.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/dallasCloseup.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Dallas</h3>
								<p>Another retired racehorse, this gelding's old bones prevent him from carrying anything but lighter riders, but his smooth gait, his twenty-two years of experience, and his loving nature make him a joy for any intermediate rider. Standing at 15.3 hands, he is gentle and calm with even the littlest of children.</p>

							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/callieCloseup.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/callieCloseup.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Callie</h3>
								<p>For our smallest learners, Callie is there to save the day! A pony who stands at 9 hands tall, she is plucky, loving, and eager to please. Whether it's being riden around the round pen or having a five year old learn to lunge, this plucky pony is ready to go!</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/cometCloseup.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/cometCloseup.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Comet</h3>
								<p>At just over a year old, Comet is not quite ready to give lessons. Still, he has stolen our hearts. He is a spunky stallion about 9 hands tall that is learning the basics of halter training.</p>
