						<h2>FAQs</h2>
					</header>
					<h4>What is the price range for lessons?</h4>
					<p>Lessons are $30 for half an hour, and $45 for an hour long lesson. If your requirements are for either longer than an hour, or you have special requests
						such as going to the arena, doing a full day venture, or you live farther away, please contact us so that we can give you a more customized option. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>What skill level do I need before starting?</h4>
					<p>Here at Atwater Ranch, we take learners of all ages and abilities. We have students as young as five on our mini-pony Calli, as well as many adult learners who are either starting for the first time, or restarting skills learned when they were young. While we don't do advanced training for competitions, we strive to instill fundamentals so that all of our students leave not only having had a great experience, but understanding how to care for a horse from A-Z. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>What is the current weight capacity of your horses?</h4>
					<p>Currently, our horses max out at approximately 200 lbs for carrying a rider.	</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>What if I have my own horse? Or no horse?</h4>
					<p>We do lessons both with our horses, and our student's horses. If you'd like to have lessons with your own horse, let us know whether you'd prefer Erin travels to your location.	</p>
					<br/>
					<h4>What days of the week are lessons available?</h4>
					<p>Here at Atwater Ranch, we practice flexible scheduling with our students. We are available either for weekday lessons or weekend lessons during daylight hours.	</p>
